Gaali derived from local language of central India refers to cussing. In India, especially in Uttar Pradesh, is perceived as an art. New and creative cusswords can be heard from each and every corner of the city and villages. Mostly they are based on feminine relationships showing the patriarchal mindsets but people here defer so. They say that gaali is not derogatory of given to a friend, it is a show of emotions. But to foe, it is a direct challenge to his or her dignity and call for intense altercation.
